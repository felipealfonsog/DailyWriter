I gotta do something incredible next time to really impress the people, to really think i am doing something absoloutly amasing and this is the most important thing that i am going to do in my life, ard if we accept the reality and we are going to accept the fact that we are not going to change anything in the futuure, or in our present tense of our life.\nIf i am abroad i''m gonna have to work in IT, which is something that i don''t like , but perhaps is going to be different for me... i know that literature is not something that is going to bring me money in the future or  is going to bring me the necessary to survive probably... because i don''t wanna be picking up vegetables in a farm or something like that... although my adventure is an adventure per se, so if we are going to think that, that is going to be really incredible if we think that noone is eepecting antythhing from me.. noone can really believe me, noone can really believe me and someone can trust me... excpet for a few people that wre could say that they are miportant  although the think are not important, but they are reallly important for me, and i think are going to achieve my projcets.\ni am going to help cesar with the webpage because is going to be productive for me and for the people i would know in the future and i think that we going to be good if i take care a lot of my prohects and i think thta t sthis is something very especial beruy spescial for me, and they knows it. and they have to ability to see me doing what i am good at. otherwise is sommething that is NOT going to be good no t even for me or my family\nto be a robot in my life is not something good and i am going to rebuild my life with all the the resources that i could have in my hands, jesus, that bitch from south africa she knew everythign from the beginning and i am here paying all the broken dushes. so to say.\nthere are momements when i feel that i can''t hold on any more and is something hurtful, to think about.\ni wanna do what i want, i wanna be inspirered i wanna feel something in my heart something that is going to tell me : hey you got a lot of potential and you  can make it. \nSomeone that suddenly is going to believe in yourself and someone that''s gonna create a path for you and your life.\nafter a while vvivisting my aunt and after to wait the mother fucker of cesar i felt good and bad as always. \n\nafter a long period of time where everything seemed to be very far i reacted  in a way  i didn''t like it. or do i?', '', 'Fri Apr 20 22:49:17 2012', 0, 'Wednesday April the 11th, 2012'),

I think this is a great tool, for me, perhaps for other people, but I will wait for the response of the owner of 750words.com despite his system is much more well developed and actually is a great system, I guess he reached a level where everything is great on his own system.\r\n\r\nthe system that he got probably got a lot of development through the years, but the system itself it completely easy to copy, it was not difficult for me to write something a platform that i can develop by myself.\r\n\r\nabout Buddhism, i think it''s not a complete bullshit what i read, but part of it it''s nothing more than crap, life is not so simple to say: hey think like this --- and then you are gonna think or experience the world in a different point of view, it''s pure bullshit, I prefer to call myself Atheist with proud, I wrote that book ''Atheism, is life'', in Spanish because in the beginning all that was written in Spanish so I had to finish the book in that language, and I loved it. Spanish is a rich language, and because is my mother tongue probably i can write more fluent something and I can do something interesting, I don''t wanna leave this the eternity of my life without to think that i am not going to be able to write about the things i want to, or the things i am going to experience in the future.\r\n\r\ntoday i spend part of the day with my aunt Irene, and her son is really an ass-hole, i don''t like it, it''s a complete ass hole if i could hit his face with my punch i would do it happily Jesus, mother they have to support sons and  husbands like himself with his beautiful wife, fuck! I would fuck her like nobody... it was incredible  ... I''d like to see myself one day living on my own, and i think the only way is to create a company of IT the things i studied for so long more than literature and will combine the two sides of my knowledge. This is not easy to do, because here I literally hate the field, but what can i do ? the things are not easy. \r\n\r\nI wanna share more with my aunts on their houses, because I''ve been here like an asshole the whole time doing the things i don''t want to do, or avoiding time that i could spend with my aunts and uncles on their houses, fuck I haven''t even been there... who the fuck do you think you are felipe? I ask myself ... .a fucking rich guy ? nooooo ... you are not a fucking rich guy.. you are nothing like the babba you met in India that changed your life forever, part of me wants to be with a side of my family that is not good with the emotions.. but my other side doesn''t want to change or do I ?? do i want to change? to become a fucking pompous guy? noooo ... that''s not what i want.\r\n\r\nanother thing that i would like to do is to read and write a lot, and that''s what i am gonna do next weekend.\r\n\r\ni want to start to work out more often by myself,  i am gonna start to do it that in the log-cabin of my uncle in the south, like an small into the wild... i don''t know if it''s good to start to a weblog for that purposes \r\n\r\n\r\njust like telling a joke I''ve decided to finish a program in Perl for blogging... but it''s a mini blog .. .in CGI ... I love it.. it''s so clean ... I think I like someone a lot... but it''s so far away ... that I can''t do anything .... anything ... it''s really far.\r\n\r\nFrom a long time i didn''t feel this ... but again I felt the power of my knowledge in IT ... I can''t erase it ... I guess I''ve chosen something... but I''m gonna fight for to be a lecturer or a writer... somehow I will fight in the future... with all my heart.... it''s very late now, tomorrow I gotta see my doctor... it''s going to be really strange this visit ... I don''t know what to say to her... it''s too early ... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '', 'Friday 13 of April 2012 06:03:16 AM', 0, 'Friday April the 13th, 2012'),
(6, 'I started to write as a way to express myself and to feel less distress from the things I think are more like daemons inside of me. This is great without this I would feel lost, everyday is a company that I can''t not longer escape, just in case i build up my own personal writer. This is a real opportunity to understand myself, to go through changes. To change is not easy, it implies more than anything  love to all the things you consider important to really understand the nature of ourselves, that''s to write for me... that''s the meaning of literature at least for me. it''s the connection between ourselves and the nature nothing more ... it''s not complex... life''s not easy for sure, but all the things that have in this world we have to appreciate them more, non matter if they are going to betray us, i discovered that is common the feeling of being betrayed... of that behavior in the human being. life''s precisely a moment when you are connected with yourself rather than other things. I think places are important to feel connected with our own selves, but when you write about what you feel that''s precious.\r\n ''m taking lithium now, i haven''t felt any bad reaction I just hope to react better with this in the future, but i feel good sign, something good is coming, and i don''t want to pretend anything bad.\r\ni think when i will be in the south i will go to run an i want to work out a lot... eat less, more tea.... that''s a good combination whether i think is great or not to dwell something that we don''t like it''s good to find the appropriated space to really feel with our own self.\r\nwhen i will be there i want to feel the ocean on my ears on my face, on my hands... in everything that could be possible to do or feel. The ocean for me is like the spirit of my own self, of my own soul, so to say it.\r\nIt''s incredible I felt again the power or the ability to rebuild my own space and it''s incredible, to feel what we could sometimes.\r\nI feel i write stupid things here, but i guess that the idea....\r\ni hope i can write often all the things here, all the things i have to say...\r\ni met another woman on the internet, she is french... very beautiful ... but i gotta put my feet underground ... and to feel that everything is going to be okay... i think next time when i will meet someone is going to be like this:\r\nfirst, i am going to say that i gotta leave Santiago\r\nsecond, i will say: are you able to trust me and to take the --fucking --- plane with me ?\r\nand if she answer: no... i will know who is beside me... if the answer is yes... i will do too... but i will know that there is a big probability that she loves me, and i can say it that 100% but if i hear that it''s tremendous and important, cause that trip, i mean my journey abroad is going to be a reality. Actually i gotta pay attention to that thing, i mean to the visas for NZ ... i think is better if i go there, i mean to the embassy .... directly there. i have no choice. it''s better actually for me. i will that after my trip... i forgot i will travel ... next Thursday ... i think is Okay.\r\nit''s important to have the good information i mean the proper information to apply in the right moment.\r\ni have done a lot of things here to really create a determination. i need to find a resolution, and that''s what i am going to discover.\r\ni feel much better with the pills, it''s incredible, i feel much better, the knowledge that my doctor has is incredible, is helping me a lot.\r\nresolutions are never easy to find, sometimes we have to dig very deep in a hole of crap to really discover what''s inside, but i think that soon my realization is gonna be real.i need to find space to find resolution.\r\nAnother thing that i consider important is to believe that there are a lot of situations that i have to consider before my departure to another country. My part psychological is very important. and I need to focus my attention to that thing too.\r\nseveral things has been happening internally, like for example that i took the determination to travel to the south, this weekend when i celebrate one year of the events that caused on me a big double depression.\r\nbut i took determinations, that can bring me the chance the forget what happened in the past. to really build a new path for me and my life.\r\n\r\n', '', 'Saturday 14 of April 2012 06:22:35 AM', 0, 'Saturday April the 14th, 2012'),
(7, 'I truly understand why sometimes we do want to be into the wild, without any sort of emotion, nothing more than pure desire for being into the wild, listening to the ocean while I''m falling asleep, everything  can be so different when you think in the things that are really important in this life. Wild life means that you are able to be with yourself on your own without any help of anybody or anything. I understand why Jennifer told me everything that she told me. .. I can feel her loneliness now, it''s not good, and it''s not nice what I''ve done with her, but she was rude with me, and I ain''t gonna let anybody to do whatever they want without to hurt too. I''ve been hurt and there''s no divine justice.\r\nAll the things i wanted with her were vanished when she sent me a message telling me ''I don''t care about you'' you don''t do that when you''ve been eating in the house of my parents... you don''t do that... beyond the fact that I use her too, during Christmas dinner, I use her, so what now.\r\ni don''t want to talk about that anymore.\r\nI am now in the nature, literally in front of the sea, alone, without anybody, I feel lonely yes, but also I feel company with the nature, I love the human being no less, but nature more. I love that poem that someone wrote about it and appears in the movie into the wild.- I feel into the wild now, in my own country, although I''m locked in a log-cabin and I can''t go to so many  places... I will wait until to see the city dark, then I will go outside. I feel that everybody is looking at me when I walk outside during the day I guess. I don''t know, I don''t feel hungry now, I think the pills are working, that''s what I wanted to feel that. to feel that I''m not hungry, but it''s gonna be different abroad, oh yep, very. That''s why I need to plan everything very carefully, i mean everything about my plan to go to live abroad.\r\nI need to do the Ielts sooner, I will have to lie to my mother in order to get money to take the test. I don''t like to do that, but I guess there is no other way, but I will do that in a while, after the big expenses with my doctor.\r\nI really hate to lie, I really do. But I have no choice. I need to prepare myself for the test, and I will do that on my own, by myself.\r\nAnother thing I consider important is the trip of my mother to Sweden, it''s gonna be hard, I hate to be alone, unless when I need it to write that''s the only case i think when I want to be alone. totally.\r\npeople in the south are warm but they are very curious, and that''s very upsetting at least for me. I am a very complex man, yea... I know, but what can I say this it it.\r\nI wonder how I would be next year in this moment WHERE? WITH WHO? it''s such a big question although is just so simple.\r\nAbout facebook, I don''t know, nobody there is really my friend, just a few of them, perhaps, just a few .... it''s sad, cause what for? why? why do i need that shit? i don''t get it... but there i am .. with a facebook page, and facebook profile, it sucks... facebook , this is more helpful more private more secure, more internal, even a psychological tool, for so many people... .thanks buster! although I started to develop my own system in case i will not have internet, and it''s very similar, very. It''s important... a toolkit just in case, Internet sometimes is not everywhere, and computer running a webserver with a database with all the entries it''s good idea. It''s almost fixed everything just a few css tricks more inside and it''s gonna be a great creation too. because to open the word or any other  thing as a word processor is NOT going to preserve the past, only a database. that''''s why I thought about it and I did it.\r\nI guess I will do a lot of reading here, I haven''t finished books that I bought and I consider them my best friends, it''s funny...
